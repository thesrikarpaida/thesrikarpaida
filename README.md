## Ahoy peeps!! ðŸ‘‹

- I am Srikar Paida, a cybersecurity graduate student at University of Maryland, College Park.
- I'm particularly interested in reverse engineering and offensive security.
- I am a constant learner, and I believe that there is always something to learn from everyone.
- I have no idea what I'm doing almost all the time (aren't we all?).
- Just existing like this vast universe we're currently in.

### Live long and prosper! Bazinga!!
